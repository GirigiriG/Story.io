                        <p>In Web design, animating things on certain events creates a much better user interaction if done correctly. But you should always avoid overuse of animations in your projects, as overuse of everything kills the UX After getting inspired by this fascinating dribbble shot (it’s an animated hamburger menu icon), I decided to give it a go with CSS. Not purely this, but something close and similar.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Before doing anything, I looked up the web and found some interesting solutions. But none was as smooth as jQuery’s slideUp, slideDown, and slideToggle, of course you gotta add and remove the dimensional and transition CSS properties for the target with JavaScript. But mind you, we don’t actually need much of JavaScript for the animation logic. We are going to add and remove a specific set of CSS properties at the right time to emulate sliding animation.</p>
